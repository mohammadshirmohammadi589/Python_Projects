    ```bash
    cd RockPaperScissors
    ```
3.  Run the script:

    ```

## How to Play

1.  When you run the script, you'll be prompted to enter your choice: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

3.  The computer's choice will be displayed.
4.  The game will announce the winner (you, the computer, or a tie).
5.  You'll be asked if you want to play again.  Enter any key to continue or "q" (or "Q") to quit.

## Code Explanation

*   **`RockPaperScissors` Class:**
    *   `choices`: A list containing the valid choices: "rock", "paper", and "scissors".
    *   `get_user_choice()`: Prompts the user for their choice and validates the input. If the input is invalid, it prompts the user again until a valid choice is entered.
    *   `get_computer_choice()`: Randomly selects the computer's choice from the `choices` list.
    *   `decide_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)`: Determines the winner based on the game rules.  It returns a string indicating the outcome of the game.
    *   `play()`: The main method that orchestrates a single round of the game. It gets the user's choice, gets the computer's choice, displays the computer's choice, and prints the result of the game.

*   The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block creates an instance of the `RockPaperScissors` class and starts the game loop. The loop allows the player to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.

## Requirements
*   Python 3.x
