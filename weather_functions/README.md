Weather Forecast CLI: A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction

This project presents a user-friendly weather forecast command-line interface (CLI) built using Python. It empowers you to retrieve and display weather information in various formats, catering to your specific needs.

Installation

To get started, clone this repository or download the code files. Ensure you have  argparse library installed.


pip install argparse


Features

Display all weather data: View a comprehensive overview of weather conditions for all available cities  
Specify city name: Obtain weather details for a particular city by providing its name as an argument.
5-day forecast: Access the next five days' weather forecast for the specified city.
Detailed information: Delve deeper into specific weather parameters for the chosen city.
Command logging (optional): Enable logging of executed commands to track usage patterns 
Command-Line Arguments

The CLI utilizes argparse to facilitate user interaction through arguments:

--all: Presents all available weather data.
--city <CITY_NAME>: Specifies the city for which to retrieve weather information.
--forecast: Displays the 5-day forecast for the specified city.
--details: Provides detailed weather data for the designated city.
--show-logs: Activates command logging (optional).
Usage Examples

Display all weather data (if implemented):


python weather_cli.py --all


Check weather for "London":


python weather_cli.py --city London


Get the 5-day forecast for "Paris":


python weather_cli.py --city Paris --forecast


View detailed weather data for "Berlin":


python weather_cli.py --city Berlin --details




Code Structure

The core functionalities of the CLI reside in two primary functions:

setup_arg_parser(): Initializes the command-line argument parser using argparse. It defines the available arguments and their descriptions.
main(): Orchestrates command execution. It handles the following processes:
Loads weather data (requires load_weather_data implementation).
Parses command-line arguments using the parser from setup_arg_parser().
Manages command logging if the --show-logs flag is present (requires log_command implementation).
Executes various actions based on provided arguments:
Displays all weather data (--all).
Shows weather information for a specific city (--city).
Retrieves the city's 5-day forecast (--forecast).
Presents detailed weather data (--details).
Provides help documentation if no valid arguments are given.
Dependencies

This CLI relies on the argparse library for command-line argument parsing.

Conclusion

This weather forecast CLI exemplifies the power and flexibility of Python for building user-interactive applications. By customizing this template and leveraging external APIs, you can create a comprehensive and personalized weather information tool.
